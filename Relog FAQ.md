# Relog FAQ

A collection of commonly asked questions about Relog.

If you have a question that isn't answered here, feel free to [reach out](mailto://lonnie@lonniegerol.com).



## Is it possible to search for tasks in Relog?

Yep! You can search for tasks but the UI only appears in the Tasks tab if you have **10 or more** tasks.


## Can I Import my data from other apps?

Yep, I even have a few pre-made Shortcuts for commonly requested apps. Let me know if you run into any issue using any of them!

If you are using an app that isn't listed here, feel free to reach out and I can make a shortcut for you. If you are feeling adventurous you can also make your own Shortcut.

### Prerequisites

* Enable `Allow Sharing Large Amounts of Data` which can be found in `Settings.App < Shortcuts < Advanced`
* Create an export of any existing data in Relog (`Relog Settings < Manage Your Data < Export Your Data`) 

If import partially fails, you can clear the data in Relog by navigating to the Settings Tab, scrolling to "Manage Your Data" and selecting "Delete All Data".

If you are a developer of another task logging app, I encourage you do add import from Relog
to your app. [I have documented the file format that I use to export data from Relog](https://github.com/Lontronix/Relog-Documentation/blob/main/export-format.md).


## Will you ever charge for Relog?

I plan on adding a tip jar in the future, and might charge for future features if they require on-going server costs or take a significant amount of effort to implement. However, any features that currently exist in the app will **never** be put behind a paywall.

My goal is to make sure the fundamentals of Relog are able to be used by everyone.
